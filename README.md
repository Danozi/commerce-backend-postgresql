The purpose of this project was to design and implement a robust, normalized, and scalable relational database backend for a modern e-commerce platform. The system aimed to support core functionalities such as customer registration, product browsing, shopping cart management, inventory tracking, and secure payment processing. By adhering to principles of data normalization (up to Third Normal Form) and integrating automation through PL/pgSQL triggers, the project ensures high data integrity, eliminates redundancy, and enables efficient reporting and business logic execution. This backend architecture serves as the foundation for a reliable and maintainable e-commerce application capable of supporting both operational transactions and analytical queries.
